# File Hygiene Rules

## Minimize New Files
- Do not create extra files unless explicitly needed for the task.
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new versions or duplicates.

## Temporary Files
- If a temporary or process file is required, place it under `temp/`.
- Delete temporary files after the task is complete.

## Rules/Skills Change Log
- Record any change to `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursor/skills/` (add, update, delete)
  in `RULES_SKILLS_CHANGELOG.md`.
- Always update the existing log; never create a new log file for this purpose.

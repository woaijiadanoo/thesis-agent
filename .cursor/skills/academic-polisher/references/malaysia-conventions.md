# Malaysian University Thesis Conventions

Style guide for Malaysian universities (UM, UPM, UTM, USM, UKM).

## Voice and Perspective

### First-Person Elimination

Convert all first-person to passive voice or objective descriptions:

| First-Person | Passive Alternative |
|--------------|---------------------|
| I conducted | The experiment was conducted |
| We observed | It was observed that |
| I analyzed | The data were analyzed |
| We propose | This study proposes |
| My research | This research |
| Our findings | The findings |
| I believe | It is believed |
| We conclude | It can be concluded |

### Objective Subjects

Use these instead of "I" or "We":
- This study
- This research
- The analysis
- The experiment
- The investigation
- The present work
- The current research
- The proposed method
- The findings
- The results

## Tone Requirements

### Formal Academic Tone

- Avoid contractions: "do not" not "don't"
- Avoid colloquialisms and slang
- Avoid rhetorical questions
- Avoid exclamation marks
- Use formal vocabulary (see vocabulary-upgrades.md)

### Third-Person Throughout

- Exception: Direct quotations may contain first-person
- Exception: Acknowledgments section may use first-person

## Paragraph Structure

### Minimum Length Rule

Every paragraph MUST have at least 3 sentences:
1. Topic sentence (main idea)
2. Supporting evidence/explanation
3. Connection/transition sentence

### Short Paragraph Handling

If a paragraph has only 1-2 sentences:
- Expand with supporting details, or
- Merge with adjacent paragraph on same topic

### Paragraph Boundaries

Paragraphs with exactly 3 sentences are acceptable but consider:
- Can more supporting evidence strengthen the argument?
- Is the transition to the next paragraph smooth?

## Section Structure

### Standard Chapter Format

1. Introduction (chapter overview)
2. Main content sections
3. Summary (chapter conclusions)

### Section Transitions

Each section should:
- Begin by stating its purpose
- End by connecting to the next section

## Citation Style Notes

- Follow APA 7th edition (most Malaysian universities)
- Some use IEEE or Harvard - check university guidelines
- Ensure consistent citation format throughout

## Language Considerations

### Malaysian English Variants

Standard British English is typically preferred:
- "behaviour" not "behavior"
- "analyse" not "analyze"
- "organisation" not "organization"
- "colour" not "color"

### Mixed Language Content

When Malay/Chinese terms appear:
- Italicize non-English terms on first use
- Provide English translation in parentheses
- Subsequent uses may omit translation

## Formatting Notes

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals with units: "5 cm"

### Abbreviations

- Define on first use: "Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
- Use abbreviation thereafter
- Common abbreviations (e.g., etc., i.e.) need no definition

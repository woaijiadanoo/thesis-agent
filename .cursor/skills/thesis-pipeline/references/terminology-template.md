## Key Terms

Define canonical spelling and usage for important terms:

### Technical Terms

- **deep learning** - lowercase in prose, not "Deep Learning"
- **dataset** - one word, not "data set"
- **real-time** - hyphenated when used as adjective
- **machine learning** - lowercase unless at sentence start
- **neural network** - two words, lowercase

### Domain-Specific Terms

- **[Your Term 1]** - [definition/usage notes]
- **[Your Term 2]** - [definition/usage notes]
- **[Your Term 3]** - [definition/usage notes]
